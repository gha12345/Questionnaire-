A broad assessment of the legacy system would reveal the following two categories:

Business value assessment - includes assessing the system’s functionality and performance, quality of services provided, supported business processes, dependability, and system outputs.

System quality assessment - considers all the components of the system both environment and application software.

Environment assessment - supports both hardware and software platforms in terms of performance, maintenance costs, interoperability, failure rate, supplier stability, etc. 

Application software assessment – supports quantitative data like volume of data, system change requests, different user interfaces, etc. It also addresses factors in application software like programming language, configuration management, test data, etc.
